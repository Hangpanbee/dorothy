# Dorothy

## Who is Dorothy?

Dorothy - the smart therapist friend. Dorothy is an AI-powered assistant that aims to help guide you towards understanding your thoughts and feelings
using behavioral cognitive therapy techniques. The target age is 15-21.


## Why is Dorothy needed?

Mental health should not be an issue that is ignored. Therapy should be something that you don't loathe, or avoid. We know that mental health treatment is an important part of a childâ€™s healing and that addressing the impact of trauma on the child significantly reduces harm and decreases the risk for future abuse. Therapy can help a child work through difficult, confusing and painful feelings in a safe setting. Therapy also provides children with the tools for going forward and leading healthy, productive lives. This is why we developed Dorothy.
